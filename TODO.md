# Balance Fluctuation Implementation

- [x] Modify balance chart to use dynamic data (last 20 balances) instead of static months
- [x] Add variables for current balance, initial balance, and 24H change tracking
- [x] Create updateBalance function with random percentage changes (-2% to +2%)
- [x] Set interval to update balance every 5-10 seconds
- [x] Update HTML elements for balance amount and change percentage
